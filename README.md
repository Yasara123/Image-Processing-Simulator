# Image-Processing-Simulator
This project has 3 phases and each phase added the new functionality to the system. Those add functions
are as below:

<br><b>1.1 PHASE I
<br>1. GUI framework
<br>2. Image loading
<br>3. Save and Save As operations
<br>4. Image cloning (clone image to another window)
<br>5. RGB Channel Splitting

<br><br><b>1.2 PHASE II
<br>1. Re-sampling and scaling by any given factor (user should be able to select the sampling
method)
<br>2. Compute and display histogram
<br>3. Negative, Brightness and contrast adjustments
<br>4. Contrast stretching and normalization

<br><br><b>1.3 PHASE III
<br>1. Bit-plane based run length coding of an image
<br>2. Huffman coding of gray level images (8bpp) (convert any RBG image into gray scale.
<br>Save code book in as image header)
<br>3. LOG filter of an image (5x5 and 7x7 mask)
<br>4. Filter an image based on a user specified 3x3 mask
